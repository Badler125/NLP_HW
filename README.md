# NLP_HW

This project uses natural language processing to give us a better understanding of the general sentiment around Bitcoin an Ethereum in recent news articles. Some additional NLP techniques were used to help discover other factors that may influence coin prices such as commom words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles. 

## Technologies
This project is written in python and uses various libraries such as: pandas, nltk, and SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.

## Findings
After doing a quick analysis of the sentiment scores, I found that Bitcoin had a much more positive score than Ethereum. I found a difference in sentiment score of this magnitude to be quite unusual; so after taking a closer look at the articles being analyzed I suspect that the cause of this discrepancy is largely due to the news about El Salvador making Bitcoin legal tender.
